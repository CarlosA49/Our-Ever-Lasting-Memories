<section class="milestone-message">
        <p>Milestones are meaningful moments between you and I, pookie, and they show us a reminder of growth, love,</p>
        <p>shared experiences, and overcome challenges and obstacles together as one.</p>
        <p>The moment we talk about our future, whether it's a joke or not, I like it because</p>
        <p>it shows a strong sign that we look forward to the future together, pookie.</p>
        <p>We may face trials and hardships within the relationship, but I believe in us. I believe in this relationship.</p>
        <p>I believe that this relationship is meant to be for both of us, pookie. These challenges are proof of our</p>
        <p>resilience and commitment, my love. Our small traditions, like weekly late-night walks</p>
        <p>or spontaneous dates, or how we celebrate our monthsary and anniversary soon, are a reminder that</p>
        <p>love shows in small consistent actions.</p>
        <p>Watching each other grow from one challenge to another and finding joy in each other's growth</p>
        <p>is a joyful experience because it's the realization that you are not building your life alone, pookie,</p>
        <p>but as a team, my love. Adapting to each new situation, not for the sake of ourselves but for us as a couple,</p>
        <p>is a major milestone, pookie.</p>
        <p>It shows that we can embrace the unknown with confidence when we have each other. When you allow</p>
        <p>yourself to be vulnerable with me, pookie, it is a deep milestone of trust, something that is hard to share</p>
        <p>with one another, pookie. So, building these connections of honesty and genuine care, you will</p>
        <p>realize that love is embracing each other's whole being, baby.</p>
        <p>These milestones remind us that love isn't about perfect moments like in Hollywood movies, but it's about growing together,</p>
        <p>being there for each other, embracing each other's whole being, and finding beauty and joy in the journey.</p>
        <p>I will always love you, pookie, no matter what. My love for you is infinite, even beyond the boundaries of the infinite universe ❤️.</p>
        <p>- Carlos Robles/Pookieee</p>
